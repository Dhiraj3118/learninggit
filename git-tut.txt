Version 1:

1) git status: gives the status of repository. If the folder is not git repository then it shows error. If the folder is git repo but it has some files untracked then they are shown in red font while those in the staging area are shown in green font. Even if the file is not staged after modification in git then this will show the file in red font. If added to staging area and then modified so git status will show two times the same file once in green and once in red font.

2) git init: initializes empty git repository. Means this folder is made a git repository. It creates a folder named .git which is hidden.

3)git add --a: adds all the files to the staging area.
	{--a -> all}

  git add filename.exe: add the specific file to staging area.

4)git commit -m "msg" : commit the files in the staging area with the msg.
	{if we write only git commit then it will open an editor}

5)git log: shows all the commit done in the repo along with author and date

6)rm -rf .git: this deletes the .git folder and so our repo will be no more a git repo.

7)git clone url name: this will clone the repo whose url we have used in the command. This url is mostly from github which provides us with option of clone repo and gives us the url. name is optional. Means if we give the name then the repo will be saved by that name else it will be cloned by the it's name on that url. Now if we do some commit in this cloned repo then in git status it will show how much commits we are ahead or back from the original repo.

8)touch filename: creates the file in the repo

touch .gitignore to make a file named .gitignore. In this file save the filenames which you don't want git to track.

9)git diff: it shows the difference in files of staging area and working directory. 

git diff --staged: this shows difference in files in last commit and staging area.
